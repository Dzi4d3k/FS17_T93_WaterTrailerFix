        <text name="T93_Help_WTF_01" text="The WaterTrailerFix mod is very simple, it only allows you to empty your liquids trailer." />
        <text name="T93_Help_WTF_02" text="This emptying isn't very useful for a trailer that can only carry water, but is mostly useful when it can also carry other liquids, like fuel or liquid manure." />
        <text name="T93_Help_WTF_03" text="For example, when you just brought water to your animals, but you brought too much, you wouldn't be able to use that trailer for transporting oter liquids, since you have no means of emptying the trailer. Now you do." />
